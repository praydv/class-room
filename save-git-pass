EXAMPLES
The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your username or password. For example:
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>

[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]

STORAGE FORMAT
The .git-credentials file is stored in plaintext. Each credential is stored on its own line as a URL like:

https://user:pass@example.com
